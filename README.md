# Angualr Webpack Boilerplate

> quick boilerplate for angular project using webpack includes tests (no css framework)

### Usage
clone this repo and then `npm install` for dependencies. `npm test` to run tests and `npm start` to run dev server.
visit: `http://loclhost:8080`

### Libs
- dev server is based on express.js using webpack dev middleware
- test using karma, chai mocha and sinon
- angular-ui-router for routing

I used my opinionated architecture here, however it is very easy to implement your own idea.
